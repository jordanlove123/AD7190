# AD7190
This is a library for interfacing with the AD7190 ADC using Arduino SPI and is based off of Kerry Wong's [AD770x library](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/ad7705-with-kerry-d-wong-library/1073620). This was made for a personal project so there isn't functionality for every part of the chip, but there is enough to have a reasonable amount of control.
