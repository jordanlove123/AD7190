# AD7190
This is a library for interfacing with the AD7190 ADC using SPI on the Arduino UNO R4 minima and is based off of Kerry Wong's [AD770x library](http://www.kerrywong.com/2011/03/20/ad7705ad7706-library/). This was made for a personal project so there isn't functionality for every part of the chip, but there is enough to have a reasonable amount of control.

# Relevant information
For more information in some of the code, there are some comments that say refer to the datasheet. This can be found [here](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ad7190.pdf). As of writing this, the current version is revision C so if it has changed, the page numbers in those comments may be incorrect.

This program works by using [SPI](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/analog-dialogue/articles/introduction-to-spi-interface.html) to read and write to the AD7190's on-chip registers. Each register represents a category of information and the bits of each register represent a particular piece of information within that category. For example, the communication register (datasheet p.19): [Communication Register Layout](images/communication.png "Communication register layout (p.19)")
This register, shockingly, contains information for communicating with the chip. According to the datasheet, all communication starts with a write to this register, so for example if you wanted to write to the second register (mode), you would write 010 to the CR3-5 bits.
