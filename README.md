# AD7190
This is a library for interfacing with the AD7190 ADC using Arduino SPI and is based off of Kerry Wong's [AD770x library](http://www.kerrywong.com/2011/03/20/ad7705ad7706-library/). This was made for a personal project so there isn't functionality for every part of the chip, but there is enough to have a reasonable amount of control.

# Relevant information
For more information in some of the code, there are some comments that say refer to the datasheet. This can be found [here](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ad7190.pdf). As of writing this, the current version is revision C, so if it has changed, the page numbers may be incorrect.
